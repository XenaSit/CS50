@David J. Malan Is the CS50.ai updates and upgrades as based on the questions and conversational design input by the users, and up to what extent these updates and upgrades will happen. And also, I see that this is being used more on VS Code. Will you also delve/include this on other IDEs that is not present in a codespace?

Hello world. It's a pleasure being part of this workshop.
@David J. Malan 
Is it a great idea to learn C and C++ simultaneously?
I'm a freshman at the CopperBelt University in Zambia and we are using C++ for learning. I'm also taking cs50x on edx and I wanted to know the right way to learn.
Looking forward to your reply 

David J. Malan 2:49 PM
I‚Äôd pick one or the other. I‚Äôd recommend learning C, then C++, as the latter solves problems that you‚Äôll eventually run into with the former. (I.e., C++ introduces OOP, which allows for, arguably, cleaner implementations of some solutions.)

Ebenezer Amoaful  to  Everyone 2:50 PM
Thank you very much David J. Malan

Jerome Ancheta  to  Everyone 2:50 PM
is there freshman or sophomore here using java? 

Ethan Caudy  to  Everyone 2:48 PM
@David J. Malan A lot of "real" on campus education involves making lasting connections with professors and peers. How can we avoid losing those connections when the DDB idea goes to scale, both on campus and for online students? Clearly Dr. Malan et all can't answer 5.7 million emails for EdX.

David J. Malan 2:53 PM
Ideally, leveraging a bit of AI would open up even more time for those kinds of connections, to ask professors/TAs for advice more generally rather than asking ‚ÄúFAQs‚Äù about material alone. In CS50‚Äôs case on campus, we still try to invite 50+ students to lunch each Friday to get to know them. We have our CS50 Puzzle Day, CS50 Hackathon, and CS50 Fair. And I‚Äôd argue those are time better spent than, often, sitting in large classes or office hours.

Vishwas Singh  to  Everyone 2:48 PM
@David J. Malan At the end when you were talking about the one on one oral exams with AI did you mean like have AI grade students? (After a few revision in the AI of course)

David J. Malan 2:53 PM
Correct!

Shu Yang  to  Everyone 2:50 PM
What‚Äôs vector representation?

Fahad Aslam 2:53 PM
Computers don't understand words, therefore it needs to be converted into numbers. Vector represntation is a numerical represnetation of words in a high dimensional vector space.

David J. Malan 2:54 PM
You might find that CS50P or CS50W or CS50 AI are a good opportunity to get more comfortable with programming specifically. You could also take https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1, which might give you a leg up on more theoretical coursework.

Mohammad shahnawaz  to  Everyone 2:55 PM
@David J. Malan Sir, I have completed CS50x and CS50w and currently doing CS50ai , but it feels that I am not doing much and progress. As there is no interaction with industries. So my question is how can I connect to industries people and check if I am good enough.

Vladislav Baidin  to  Everyone 2:49 PM
@David J. Malan Considering the ease of obtaining solutions to coding tasks from AI chatbots, do you think relying on such tools can diminish our creativity and problem-solving skills? How should we balance the use of AI assistance with the development of independent coding competencies?

David J. Malan 2:56 PM
Yup, but I‚Äôd like to think that people who enjoy the process will generally reach for those tools only to automate/expedite the uninteresting/tedious stuff. Not unlike using Google to look something up rather than leafing through a book. I tend to view ChatGPT, at the moment, as a Google 2.0.

Omama Khan  to  Everyone 2:50 PM
I have recently completed CS50p, and though i took quite long time to complete the course, i am in doubt whether i should go for cs50ai (which is my goal) or go to cs50x and complete that? I am not too good but sometimes i get solutions without seeking help.

Frantz Perea Cobos  to  Everyone 2:53 PM
Hello, all! I‚Äôm on chat now if you have other questions about the first part of the workshop. (I‚Äôll do my best to keep up but also need to listen to Rongxin!)
Hello, I just want to share that I started CS50 in 2022, finished all but the final project in 2023. In my case I didn't used the duck, but later on I've been using ChatGPT for improvement of code I have written for personal projects. And I have found it very useful in terms of debugging. The only challenge is that ChatGPT seems to forget olders part of the discussion, so at some point it feels like you are starting over. I guess it has to do with token size.

David J. Malan 2:59 PM
Correct, ChatGPT (and CS50‚Äôs duck) only remember your past N exchanges. In CS50‚Äôs case, N tends to be 20.

Ryan Robinson  to  Everyone 2:52 PM

Valeria Cerpa  to  Everyone 2:57 PM
If we don‚Äôt understand a coding problem, could it be a good use to  ask another way to explain the problem/task in other words? Or explain the problem in small steps for better understanding with AI tool. Could it be a good idea of learning when you are beginner?

I am Partho from Bangladesh.
I am a big fan of yours; you have a very unique teaching technique;


My question is, I am a problem solver (competitive programmer).
I write code keeping time complexity in mind.
That's why my primary coding language is C++. But now when I code with Python, it's hard for me to calculate time.
Can you tell me some techniques to analyze time complexity of Python code?

David J. Malan 3:08 PM
Generally speaking, Python isn‚Äôt any different than C++ when it comes to asymptotic analysis. I‚Äôd just look at each line of code, top to bottom, and ask yourself whether the line will take 1 step, or N steps, or more, then add/multiply as you would for a C++ program too!

Andrew Charlton 3:08 PM
We can always tweek the code from here too. I made my first few websi9tes this way so I had something to work with. 
Modifying the code is a great step to learning how to build a site from scratch.

Sebastian Gil 3:08 PM
In my humble opinion, while they save a lot of work, especially repetitive tasks, one must have a good understanding of what they do underneath, otherwise, one is exposed to certain security flaws and such.

@David J. Malan Why do you use prompt engineering instead of just fine tuning GPT 3.5/GPT4?

David J. Malan 3:21 PM
Fine-tuning doesn‚Äôt tend to be very effective when your/our volume of training data is just a drop in the bucket vis-a-vis the model‚Äôs own training data. So ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù and prompt engineering tend to be more effective.

Ishtiaque Ahmed Rafin 3:22 PM

Collin Whalen  to  Everyone 3:22 PM
@David J. Malan As LLMs improve in capabilities I am wondering, could society get to a point where it is difficult to not be using a chatbot in order to stay competitive in the workforce and job market?

David J. Malan 3:33 PM
I imagine it would depend on the human‚Äôs role and industry!

Vishwas Singh  to  Everyone 3:34 PM
@David J. Malan Ok, this is a really silly question but have you guys ever like asked ChatGPT (or some other AI) to give some suggestions on what more you should implement in you duck ai and other stuff you are working on using AI?

Riddhiraj Sehgal  to  Everyone 3:34 PM
Hi @David J. Malan Why were the captions being chunked to 500 characters of data for each vector? Why couldn‚Äôt we do it for the entire thing or do it for 50 characters each. How does it matter?

Fahad Aslam 3:35 PM
to fit within the prompt context window of the GPT model.

David J. Malan 3:36 PM
If you get a chance to ask Rongxin, I‚Äôd defer to him! I suspect we experimented with different window sizes.

how to enroll to CS50 for students abroad (Morocco) to study there in the US

Vishwas Singh  to  Everyone 3:34 PM
yup he did that

@David J. Malan Ok, this is a really silly question but have you guys ever like asked ChatGPT (or some other AI) to give some suggestions on what more you should implement in you duck ai and other stuff you are working non using AI?

David J. Malan 3:35 PM
The team might have, but these are somewhat uncharted waters! Am sure the duck will have more to say eventually!

Kevin Liu  to  Everyone 3:36 PM
@David J. Malan Dr. Malan, do you think we will be reaching to a point where we do not need to know about low-level details anymore, and instead being replaced with high level abstractions. For example, I want to implement an adversarial game search algorithm to a system, and then we only need to prompt the LLM with requirements and design patterns, and it will generate us a full implementation? 
At that point, do you think computer science, software engineering, and related fields will be converged into a smaller set of disciplines, or perhaps being merged into other fields as a tool instead?

Xiu Shi  to  Everyone 3:36 PM
Thank you CS50 for sharing the source code! Rongxin, your work is inspiring!

@David J. Malan 

I am Partho from Bangladesh.
I am a big fan of yours; you have a very unique teaching technique.
My question is, I am a problem solver (competitive programmer).
I write code keeping time complexity in mind.
That's why my primary coding language is C++. But now when I code with Python, it's hard for me to calculate time.
Can you tell me some techniques to analyze time complexity of Python code?

David J. Malan 3:11 PM
See above!

Sunday Afolabi  to  Everyone 3:19 PM
How does vector generated?

Sunday Afolabi 3:31 PM
I don't get 

Gediminas Kolinis 3:34 PM
Right so you have a vector with certain value say it‚Äôs value is ‚Äòblue‚Äô and another vector say with value ‚Äòmonster‚Äô and when the query solves the vectors you want to know the distance between two vectors(value vector connecting those two), and if query is ‚Äòblue monster‚Äô that vector should be quite short or something like that

Sunday Afolabi 3:42 PM
So, what now the vector DB, vector representation?

Graham Blundell  to  Everyone 3:42 PM
Thanks Rongxin and David! You guys are awesome

cillo cotton jr  to  Everyone 3:42 PM
you did good bro I definitely would have done worse

When chunking the reference data, why is the info embedded as numbers? In other words, why are we converting the data?

Thank you David and team CS50 for this interesting and informative workshop, you have helped to make AI chatbot more clear for me !

cillo cotton jr  to  Everyone 3:47 PM
I literally had gemini linked to my docs and had it literaly wrote in my format

Yudha E. Saputra  to  Everyone 3:47 PM
maybe limited to certain purpose. for examples, cover letter by chatgpt, looks so similar no matter the role. maybe can start from there

cillo cotton jr  to  Everyone 3:47 PM
write ha ha

harold finz  to  Everyone 3:48 PM
Like every good presentation, I am left with more questions than answers‚Ä¶ and I received several answers. Thanks again.
